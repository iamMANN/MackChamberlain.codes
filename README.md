# Plans
I plan to create a very fluid and interactive website to display my accomplishments and previous projects.
This website will act as my personal portfolio to give to future employers to demonstrate my ability to write software.

I hope to incorporate some form of JQuery or AngularJS to demonstrate my abilities.

Hope to add:
* Mobile Friendly Features
* Javascript
* JQuery
* AngularJS
