            <h1>Raspberry Pi Work</h1>
            <article>
              Ever since the Raspberry Pi became easily accessible for the public,
              I had been interested and tinkering with them. I have used my
              Raspberry Pi for a wide range of projects. From running a little
              web server, to my latest project, creating a car data logging system.
              <br>
              I think the Raspberry Pi has really peaked my interest because it is
              something that I can work with hands on, and apply my software
              development experience to. Another reason why it had peaked my
              interest (and for many others as well), was because it was cheap
              and affordable for a college student like me.
              <br>
              Alright, enough about why I like Raspberry Pi's, onto my projects!

            <h2>Raspberry Pi Car Data Logger</h2>
            <article>
              Alright, This project is probably my biggest project undertaken
              with a Raspberry Pi, and I am working to develop a data logger for
              my car. The project is still in progress, and is not done yet, so I
              am going to put what I have done so far here.
            </article>

            <h3>Plan</h3>
            <article>
              My idea was to use a Raspberry Pi to read engine data from my car,
              and store it in a time series data format. I could then use my
              experience with R and Shiny to create a web application on a server
              to plot and display that data. This would allow me to see trends in my
              vehicle's temps, transmission, fuel efficiency, speed, and
              overall health.
              <br>
              I decided to use OBD to read those sensors from the engine. When most
              people think of OBD, they think Check Engine Light. That is the most
              common use of OBD, what it was intended to do, diagnose problems.
              However, all cars can also provide engine sensor data over the OBD
              interface as well.
