                <p>
                  I had gone to Anoka Ramsey Community College from Fall 2011 to Spring 2014.
                  While I was there, I had taken my general classes and had completed all
                  the requirements for an Associates of Science degree in Computer Science.
                  Not only was I taking the classes, I was also the President of the Computer Science Club for two years.
                  I also took a job as a Computer Science tutor for a year to help other students understand the concepts of computer science.

                  <h4>University of Minnesota: Twin Cities</h4>
                  <p>
                    I had transferred to the University of Minnesota in the Fall of 2014 to work towards my Bachelors degree in Computer Science.
                    I am currently a University of Minnesota student, and I expect to graduate with my Bachelor's Degree in May of 2016.
                    At the university, I am taking mostly upper division classes that were not available from Anoka Ramsey Community College.
                    In addition to taking classes, I am an active member of the ACM chapter on campus.

                    There are many skills that I have learned on my own. Some I am good at due to interest, others I am not.
                    A lot of my self-taught skills are due to me picking up projects and learning the skills to get the project done.
