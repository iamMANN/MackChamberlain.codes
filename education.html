                    I had transferred to the University of Minnesota in the Fall of 2014 to work towards my Bachelors degree in Computer Science.
                    At the university, I am taking mostly upper division classes that were not available from Anoka Ramsey Community College.
                    In addition to taking classes, I am an active member of the ACM chapter on campus.

                    I had gone to Anoka Ramsey Community College from Fall 2011 to Spring 2014.
                    While I was there, I had taken my general classes and had completed all
                    the requirements for an Associates of Science degree in Computer Science.
                    Not only was I taking the classes, I was also the President of the Computer Science Club for two years.
                    I also took a job as a Computer Science tutor for a year to help other students understand the concepts of computer science.
